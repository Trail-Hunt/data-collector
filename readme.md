### SETUP
1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/. Python 3.10 is available now. For our purposes it should be safe to
   install it.
2. Install all the dependencies by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. All the dependencies should be added to
   requirements.txt
3. Run the code by using `python [file-name].py`. Please feel free to add additional python files to test things out and 
    run your code by replacing file-name with the appropriate name.
